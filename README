This project adds a new backend to gloss that can be used to embed
gloss images/animations/simulations in GTK+ applications. It uses
the gtkglext package available in Hackage.

Current status is: not finished, still under development.  Do not use
(I'm not joking here) in production just yet.

How this works: in the arguments to 'display', use the InWidget
constructor, and pass a Gtk container as first argument. The canvas
will be added to the container using Graphics.UI.Gtk.containerAdd.
