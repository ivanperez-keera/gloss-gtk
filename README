This project adds a new backend to gloss that can be used to embed
gloss images/animations/simulations in GTK+ applications. It uses
the gtkglext package available in Hackage.

Current status is: not finished, still under development.  Do not use (I'm not
joking here) in production just yet.

How this works: in the arguments to 'display', use the InWidget constructor,
and pass an eventbox as first argument. The necessary event handlers will be
installed there.

Why an event box: I understand that this is not the best solution. It's work in
progress. In a few days, it will probably turn into a (ContainerClass a) or
even something more generic. If you have ideas on this regard, I'll be happy to
know.
